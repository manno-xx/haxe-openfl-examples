/**
 * Collision detection demo.
 * Demonstrates:
 * - basic built-in hitTestObject(). Uses Axis Aligned Bounding Box (= fast)
 * - rectangle intersection with adjusted rects. Uses Axis Aligned Bounding Box (= fast and customizable to some extent)
 *
 * AABB collision detection is crude but very fast. 
 * Crude because the in game objects cannot always be properly represented by the single rectangle used for the collision detection
 * Fast because the collision check only needs to compare 2 numbers at max four times 
 *   (if the right size of rect A is 'greater' than the left side of rect B, the rects cannot overlap. repeat for all sides)
